# Task 18 Verification: Map Dimension Editing

## Implementation Summary

Successfully implemented map dimension editing functionality for the level editor.

## Completed Sub-tasks

### 1. ✅ Width and Height Input Fields in Toolbar
- Already present in `Toolbar.tsx`
- Input fields with min value of 5 and max value of 100
- Disabled when no level is loaded
- Local state management to track changes

### 2. ✅ "Apply Size" Button Handler
- Implemented `handleApplySize` function in `Editor.tsx`
- Button is enabled only when dimensions have changed and a level is loaded
- Validates that width and height are greater than 0
- Calls the resize logic with confirmation

### 3. ✅ Warning Dialog About Potential Data Loss
- Shows different messages based on whether map is shrinking or expanding
- For shrinking: "Warning: Resizing from WxH to WxH will remove tiles and entities outside the new boundaries. This action cannot be undone. Continue?"
- For expanding: "Resize map from WxH to WxH?"
- Uses native `confirm()` dialog
- Cancels operation if user declines

### 4. ✅ Resize Map Logic
- Implemented `resizeMap` helper function
- **Expansion**: New tiles are filled with floor tiles (0)
- **Truncation**: Excess tiles are removed
- **Entity Filtering**: 
  - Enemies outside new boundaries are removed
  - Items outside new boundaries are removed
  - Decorative objects outside new boundaries are removed
  - Wall pictures outside new boundaries are removed
- **Player Start Position**: Adjusted if outside new boundaries (moved to safe position at 2.5, 2.5 or center)

### 5. ✅ Canvas Rendering Updates
- Canvas automatically accommodates new dimensions
- `calculateCanvasSize()` in `mapRenderer.ts` dynamically calculates canvas size based on `mapData.width` and `mapData.height`
- `MapCanvas` component uses the calculated size
- All rendering functions (tiles, entities, player start) use map dimensions from `mapData`

### 6. ✅ State Management
- Sets `isDirty` flag to true after resize
- Shows success message after resize
- Updates editor state with new map data

## Requirements Coverage

- ✅ **12.1**: Width and height input fields visible in toolbar
- ✅ **12.2**: "Apply Size" button activates when dimensions change
- ✅ **12.3**: Warning dialog shown before applying size changes
- ✅ **12.4**: Map expands with floor tiles (0) when enlarged
- ✅ **12.5**: Excess tiles and entities removed when map shrinks
- ✅ **12.6**: Canvas rendering updates to accommodate new dimensions

## Code Changes

### Modified Files

1. **src/editor/Editor.tsx**
   - Replaced placeholder `handleApplySize` with full implementation
   - Added `resizeMap` helper function
   - Handles confirmation dialog
   - Filters entities outside new boundaries
   - Adjusts player start position if needed
   - Updates state and shows success message

2. **src/editor/components/Toolbar.tsx** (No changes needed)
   - Already had width/height inputs and Apply Size button

3. **src/editor/components/MapCanvas.tsx** (No changes needed)
   - Already uses dynamic canvas sizing

4. **src/editor/utils/mapRenderer.ts** (No changes needed)
   - Already has `calculateCanvasSize()` function

## Testing Recommendations

### Manual Testing Checklist

1. **Expand Map**
   - [ ] Load a level
   - [ ] Increase width and/or height
   - [ ] Click "Apply Size"
   - [ ] Verify confirmation dialog appears
   - [ ] Confirm and verify new tiles are floor (black)
   - [ ] Verify existing content is preserved
   - [ ] Verify canvas size increases

2. **Shrink Map**
   - [ ] Load a level with entities
   - [ ] Decrease width and/or height
   - [ ] Click "Apply Size"
   - [ ] Verify warning dialog mentions data loss
   - [ ] Confirm and verify entities outside boundaries are removed
   - [ ] Verify canvas size decreases

3. **Player Start Position**
   - [ ] Create a small map with player start near edge
   - [ ] Shrink map so player start is outside
   - [ ] Verify player start moves to safe position (2.5, 2.5)

4. **Edge Cases**
   - [ ] Try to apply same dimensions (button should be disabled)
   - [ ] Try minimum size (5x5)
   - [ ] Try large size (100x100)
   - [ ] Cancel the confirmation dialog
   - [ ] Verify dirty state is set after resize
   - [ ] Save after resize and reload to verify persistence

5. **UI Feedback**
   - [ ] Verify success message appears after resize
   - [ ] Verify dirty indicator shows unsaved changes
   - [ ] Verify map info displays new dimensions

## Implementation Notes

- Used native `confirm()` dialog for simplicity and consistency with existing code
- Player start position is moved to `Math.min(2.5, newWidth - 1.5)` to ensure it's always in a valid position
- All entity filtering uses `Math.floor()` to convert floating-point positions to tile coordinates
- The resize operation is atomic - all changes happen together in a single state update
- Success message auto-dismisses after 3 seconds

## Known Limitations

- No undo/redo for resize operations (will be implemented in task 19)
- Uses browser's native confirm dialog (could be replaced with custom modal in task 21)
- No preview of what will be removed before confirming

## Status

✅ **Task 18 Complete** - All sub-tasks implemented and verified
