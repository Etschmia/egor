- `Ctrl+Y` - Redo
- `Delete` - Remove selected entity
- `Escape` - Close dialog / Deselect

### ✓ Document API endpoints
Documented in `docs/LEVEL-EDITOR-README.md`:
- **GET /api/levels** - List all level files
  - Response format
  - Example output
- **GET /api/levels/:filename** - Load specific level
  - Parameters
  - Success/error responses
- **POST /api/levels** - Save/create level
  - Request body format
  - Success/error responses

### ✓ Add inline code comments
Added comprehensive comments to:
- `src/editor/utils/mapRenderer.ts`:
  - Module-level documentation
  - Function documentation with JSDoc-style comments
  - Parameter descriptions
  - Return value descriptions
- `editor-server.mjs`:
  - Already had good inline comments
  - Security validation comments
  - API endpoint descriptions

### ✓ Test editor with all existing level files
Created and ran `docs/test-editor-levels.mjs`:
- Automated test script to validate all level files
- Tests parsing of TypeScript level files
- Validates GameMap structure
- Checks required fields
- Validates array dimensions
- **Result**: All 35 level files passed validation ✓

Test Results Summary:
```
Found 35 level files
✓ Successfully parsed files: 35/35
- Levels 1-7 with 5 variants each
- Dimensions range from 20x20 to 24x24
- All files have correct structure
- All required fields present
- All arrays properly formatted
```

### ✓ Verify that `npm run build` excludes editor code from production build
Verified by running `npm run build`:
- Build completed successfully
- Checked `dist/` directory contents:
  - Only contains: `index.html`, `vite.svg`, and `assets/` folder
  - No `editor.html` present
  - No editor-related JavaScript bundles
  - Production bundle size: 443.38 kB (88.74 kB gzipped)
- Editor code successfully excluded from production build ✓

## Testing Results

### Level File Compatibility Test
```
Testing Level Editor compatibility with existing level files...

Found 35 level files

✓ Successfully parsed files:
  level1-variant1.ts        LEVEL_1_VARIANT_1    20x20    E:3 I:3 W:4 D:25
  level1-variant2.ts        LEVEL_1_VARIANT_2    20x20    E:3 I:3 W:3 D:27
  [... 33 more files ...]
  level7-variant5.ts        LEVEL_7_VARIANT_5    24x24    E:10 I:6 W:2 D:27

Summary: 35/35 files passed

✓ All level files are compatible with the editor!
```

### Production Build Test
```
npm run build
✓ 82 modules transformed.
dist/index.html                   0.46 kB │ gzip:  0.29 kB
dist/assets/index-CiBOCEB1.css    7.84 kB │ gzip:  2.01 kB
dist/assets/index-D1W8PyDP.js   443.38 kB │ gzip: 88.74 kB
✓ built in 948ms

- NO editor bundles
```

## Notes

1. **Documentation Quality**: The documentation is comprehensive and covers all aspects of using the editor, from basic usage to advanced workflows.

2. **Code Comments**: Added meaningful comments to the rendering utilities. The server code already had good comments from previous tasks.

3. **Testing**: Created an automated test script that can be run anytime to verify level file compatibility. This is useful for future maintenance.

4. **Build Verification**: Confirmed that the Vite configuration correctly separates the editor from the production build.

5. **User Experience**: Documentation includes visual examples, color coding references, and troubleshooting tips to help developers use the editor effectively.

## Conclusion

Task 24 is complete. All sub-tasks have been successfully implemented and verified:
- Comprehensive documentation created
- Keyboard shortcuts documented
- API endpoints documented
- Code comments added
- All 35 level files tested and validated
- Production build verified to exclude editor code

The Level Editor is now fully documented and ready for use by developers. The documentation provides clear guidance on installation, usage, workflows, and troubleshooting.
