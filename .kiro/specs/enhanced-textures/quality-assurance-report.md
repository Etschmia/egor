## 10. Testing Recommendations

### Manual Testing
To verify texture quality in-game:

1. **Start the game** and observe all enemy types
2. **Collect items** and verify they are recognizable
3. **Navigate through doors** and verify distinguishability
4. **Check visual consistency** across all levels

### Automated Testing
A visual test page has been created: `texture-quality-test.html`

To run the test:
```bash
npm run dev
```
Then navigate to: `http://localhost:5173/texture-quality-test.html`

This page displays all textures at 3x scale for detailed inspection.
