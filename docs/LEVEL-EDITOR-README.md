# Level Editor Documentation

## Overview

The Level Editor is a development-only tool that allows you to visually create and edit level files for Hundefelsen. It runs as a separate application alongside the main game and provides an intuitive interface for designing levels without manually writing TypeScript code.

## Getting Started

### Starting the Editor

```bash
# Start both frontend and backend
npm run editor

# Or start them separately:
npm run editor:frontend  # Frontend on port 3000
npm run editor:backend   # Backend on port 3001
```

The editor will open in your browser at `http://localhost:3000`.

### Architecture

The editor consists of two components:
- **Frontend**: React-based UI (Vite + React on port 3000)
- **Backend**: Express.js file server (port 3001) that provides access to `src/levels/` directory

## Features

### Visual Level Design
- Interactive 2D top-down view of your level
- Color-coded tiles and entities for easy identification
- Hover effects and selection highlighting
- Based on the in-game minimap design

### Level Management
- Load existing levels and variants
- Create new levels and variants
- Save changes as properly formatted TypeScript files
- Resize level dimensions

### Entity Editing
- Place, edit, and remove enemies (Zombies, Monsters, Ghosts, Dogs)
- Add items (Health, Ammo, Treasure, Weapons)
- Place decorative objects (Vases, Crates, Furniture, etc.)
- Add wall pictures (Portraits, Landscapes, Abstract art)
- Set player start position and direction

### Tile Editing
- Change tile types (Floor, Wall, Door, Exit Door)
- Click-based editing with context menus

## User Interface

### Toolbar
Located at the top of the editor:
- **Level Selector**: Dropdown to choose level number
- **Variant Selector**: Dropdown to choose variant number
- **Save Button**: Save current changes to file
- **New Level Button**: Create a new level
- **New Variant Button**: Create a new variant for current level
- **Width/Height Fields**: Adjust level dimensions

## API Endpoints

The backend server provides these endpoints:

### GET /api/levels
Lists all level files in `src/levels/` directory.

**Response:**
```json
{
  "levels": [
    {
      "filename": "level1-variant1.ts",
      "level": 1,
      "variant": 1
    },
    ...
  ]
}
```

### GET /api/levels/:filename

    "items": [...],
    ...
  }
}
```

**Error Response:**

{
  "success": true
}
```

**Error Response:**
```json
{
  "success": false,
  "error": "Error message"
}
```

## File Format

The editor generates TypeScript files in this format:

```typescript
import { type GameMap, EnemyType, ItemType, WallPictureType, DecorativeObjectType } from '../types.ts';

export const LEVEL_X_VARIANT_Y: GameMap = {
  width: 20,
  height: 20,
  tiles: [
    [1, 1, 1, ...],
    [1, 0, 0, ...],
    ...
  ],
  enemies: [
    {
      id: 'enemy-1',
      type: EnemyType.ZOMBIE,
      x: 5,
      y: 5,
      health: 50,
      damage: 10,
      speed: 0.02
    }
  ],
  items: [...],
  wallPictures: [...],
  decorativeObjects: [...],
  playerStartX: 2,
  playerStartY: 2,
  playerStartDirection: 0
};
```

## Best Practices

### Level Design Tips
- Always place outer walls (tile type 1) around the level perimeter
- Ensure player start position is on a floor tile (0)
- Place at least one exit door (tile type 3) per level
- Test enemy placement - avoid blocking critical paths
- Balance item distribution throughout the level
- Use decorative objects to add visual interest
- Consider line of sight when placing enemies

### Performance Considerations
- Keep level dimensions reasonable (20x20 to 40x40)
- Don't place too many entities in one area
- Limit the number of decorative objects per level
- Test levels in the main game to verify performance

### File Management
- Use consistent naming: `levelX-variantY.ts`
- Create multiple variants for variety
- Save frequently to avoid losing work
- Keep backups of important levels

## Troubleshooting

### Editor Won't Start
- Ensure ports 3000 and 3001 are available
- Check that `npm install` completed successfully
- Verify Node.js version is compatible

### Can't Load Levels
- Check that `src/levels/` directory exists
- Verify file permissions
- Look for errors in browser console
- Check backend server logs

### Save Fails
- Ensure write permissions for `src/levels/` directory
- Check for invalid characters in filename
- Verify level data is valid
- Look for backend server errors

### Changes Not Appearing in Game
- Ensure you saved the level in the editor
- Restart the main game development server
- Clear browser cache if needed
- Check that the level file was actually updated

## Security Notes

- The editor is **development-only** and should never be deployed to production
- File access is restricted to the `src/levels/` directory only
- The backend validates all file paths to prevent directory traversal
- CORS is configured for localhost only

## Production Build

The editor code is automatically excluded from production builds:

```bash
npm run build  # Only builds the main game, not the editor
```

The editor files are kept separate and won't be included in the `dist/` directory.

## Future Enhancements

Potential features for future versions:
- Copy/paste entities
- Multi-select for batch operations
- Room templates
- Preview mode (play level directly in editor)
- Collision visualization
- Grid snapping
- Zoom controls
- Export/import as JSON
- Automatic validation (unreachable areas, etc.)

## Support

**Note**: This editor is a development tool. Always test your levels in the actual game before considering them complete.
