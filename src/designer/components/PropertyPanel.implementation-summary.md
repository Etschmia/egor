# PropertyPanel Implementation Summary

## Task 10: Create property panel component

### Implementation Date
2025-01-08

### Components Created

#### 1. PropertyGroup.tsx
A reusable collapsible group component for organizing properties.

**Features:**
- Collapsible/expandable functionality
- `defaultExpanded` prop to control initial state
- Accessible with ARIA attributes
- Smooth animations via CSS
- Arrow indicator that rotates on expand/collapse

**Props:**
- `title: string` - Group title
- `defaultExpanded?: boolean` - Initial expanded state (default: false)
- `children: ReactNode` - Group content

#### 2. PropertyPanel.tsx
Main property editing panel that displays wall type properties.

**Features:**
- Empty state when no asset is selected
- Header with asset name, description, and reset button
- Four property groups:
  - **Colors** (default expanded) - Shows all color properties with swatches
  - **Dimensions** - Shows numeric properties with values and ranges
  - **Texture** - Shows texture pattern, intensity, blend mode, and procedural flag
  - **Effects** - Shows shadow, highlight, and gradient effects with their settings
- Visual indicators for enabled/disabled effects
- Placeholder hints for future interactive controls (color picker, sliders)

**Props:**
- `asset: WallTypeDefinition | null` - The selected wall type
- `onPropertyChange: (path: string, value: any) => void` - Property change handler (for future tasks)
- `onReset: () => void` - Reset button handler

### CSS Styling

Added comprehensive styling to `styles.css`:
- Property panel layout and structure
- Property group collapsible styles
- Color swatch displays with hover effects
- Number property displays
- Text property displays
- Effect section styling with enabled/disabled states
- Gradient color display
- Responsive design for smaller screens
- Empty state styling

### Integration

Updated `Designer.tsx` to:
- Import PropertyPanel component
- Calculate selected wall type from state
- Pass selected wall type to PropertyPanel
- Add placeholder handlers for property changes and reset

Updated `components/index.ts` to export new components.

### Requirements Met

✅ **Requirement 5.1**: Property Panel displays when wall type is selected
✅ **Requirement 5.2**: Properties organized in logical groups (Colors, Dimensions, Texture, Effects)
✅ **Requirement 5.3**: Groups collapsed by default except Colors
✅ **Requirement 5.4**: Groups can be expanded/collapsed by clicking header

### Future Tasks

The following features are noted as "coming in next task" and will be implemented in subsequent tasks:
- **Task 11**: Color picker dialog for editing colors
- **Task 12**: Number slider component for editing dimensions
- Interactive property editing (currently display-only)
- Reset functionality implementation

### Testing

- ✅ TypeScript compilation successful (only expected warning for unused `onPropertyChange`)
- ✅ Component structure follows Level Editor design patterns
- ✅ Responsive layout implemented
- ✅ Accessibility features included (ARIA labels, keyboard navigation)

### Notes

- The `onPropertyChange` parameter shows a TypeScript warning because it's not used yet - this is expected and will be resolved in tasks 11 and 12 when interactive controls are added
- All property values are currently display-only; editing will be enabled in future tasks
- The component gracefully handles null/undefined assets with an empty state
- Styling follows the Level Editor dark theme consistently
